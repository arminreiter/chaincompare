    "description" : "Avalanche is a blockchain platform built with focus on high throughput, low latency and energy efficiency. It is a network of custom blockchains which is possible through Avalanche's unique architecture which consists of three individual blockchains: X-Chain (Exchange), C-Chain (Contract) and P-Chain (Platform). The X-Chain is used for creating and trading assets, the C-Chain is used for smart contracts and the P-Chain is used for creating new blockchains and validators. Avalanche is also EVM compatible and supports Solidity smart contracts. ",
